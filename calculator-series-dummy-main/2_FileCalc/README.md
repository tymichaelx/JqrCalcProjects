# Instructions:
- Build on the existing CMakeLists.txt to add and link any libraries you will need to write for your executable. 
- Do not try to lump everything together in one source file. Logically build out libraries as needed, and be prepared to justify your design choices.
- Do not change the install locations or project name from the CMakeLists.txt. This will disrupt the grading script.
- Refer to reference docs found in references folder for all further instruction
